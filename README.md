# Grasshopper-UI

**Description**: This is the front-end for [Grasshopper](https://github.com/cfpb/grasshopper), cfpb's work-in-progress geocoder.
Expect to be able to geocode individual addresses as well as batches of addresses from files or piped in from other APIs.

## Demo
  - [Andrew's version](http://cfpb.github.io/grasshopper-ui/andrew/)
  - [Wyatt's version](http://cfpb.github.io/grasshopper-ui/wyatt/)

    - These were developed in parallel to aid in prototyping new features / concepts.

## Info
  - **Technology stack**: Uses [grassjs](https://github.com/wpears/grassjs) as the geocoding library and [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/api/v2.1.5/) for the map.
  - **Status**:  Alpha

## Dependencies

  - Andrew's version runs on Jekyll with scss
  - Wyatt's version is Javascript built with browserify
